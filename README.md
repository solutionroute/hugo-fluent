# hugo-fluent
For Hugo, a responsive theme styled with [tailwindcss][1].

## Overview

`hugo-fluent` is a release-early, release-often growing Hugo theme styled using
[tailwindcss][1] and currently offers the following components:

* Home/landing page
* Article-oriented pages (suitable for blogs, too)

## Requirements

Using the theme out of the box is straightforward - see the Hugo docs.

If you add layout overrides to your site or customize the theme, you'll need to
install [tailwindcss][1] tooling to regenerate and minimize the CSS based on
your customizations.
