## I. The Arrest of Arsène Lupin

It was a strange ending to a [voyage](#) that had commenced in a most
auspicious manner. The transatlantic steamship *‘La Provence’* was a swift
and comfortable vessel, under the command of a **most affable man**. The
passengers constituted a select and delightful society. The charm of
new acquaintances and improvised amusements served to make the time pass
agreeably. We enjoyed the pleasant sensation of being separated from
the world, living, as it were, upon an unknown island, and consequently
obliged to be sociable with each other.

On the second day, at a distance of five hundred miles from the French
coast, in the midst of a violent storm, we received the following
message by means of the wireless telegraph:

> Arsène Lupin is on your vessel, first cabin, blonde hair, wound right
> fore-arm, traveling alone under name of R........

At that moment, a terrible flash of lightning rent the stormy skies.
The electric waves were interrupted. The remainder of the dispatch never
reached us. Of the name under which Arsène Lupin was concealing himself,
we knew only the initial.
